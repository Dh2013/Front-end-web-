        The best way to get around Paris is on foot and by metro. The elegant arrondissements are practically made for pedestrians.<br> Still, Paris is very big, so you should take the efficient metro to travel long distances.<br> The RÃ©gie Autonome des Transports Parisiens or RATP system, which runs the metro, also offers several bus routes around the city. <br>Those traveling to Paris by plane can arrive at Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG), about 22 miles northeast of the city center, or Paris Orly Airport (ORY), about 11 miles south of the city.<br>
